In this improved verson, the main image remains same for the attribute which do not have attribute images. 
This module provides the functionality to get the attribute image in place of main product image when user selects the particular attribute.
This functionality has a full control through admin. It can made on and off using admin.
It is very easy to integrate with zen cart.
To use this functionality ,
copy this module and run the sql query using admin sql patches. 
To ON this functionality select the option name in option name manager and put the value 6 in Attribute Style for Radio Buttons/Checkbox:text box.
It also works for check box and has additional option type Link.
It can be made off by putting value 7 .
Will appreciate responce. Please let me know your valuable comments which are very important for me to further upgrade this module.
Thanks.
